This repository contains the first version of my first android application (AntiTheftapp).  it's an anti theft application 
which is managed through sms.  
Up to now this application implements 2 functionalities 
1- Taking a picture (for doing this you have to send (#pinCode#2#) like sms from another phone) 
2- retrieving the phone location (send (#pinCode#1#) as sms cmd)
the results will be send to the email that you will enter during registration 

actually it contains some problems related to the API versions. they will be resolved later. 

Best regards 
Kahina
